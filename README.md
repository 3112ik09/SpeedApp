## LICENSE PLATE RECOGNITION 
License plate recognition (LPR), also known as automatic number plate recognition (ANPR), involves the detection, segmentation, and recognition of license plates from images or video streams. Haar cascades can be used as part of the overall pipeline for license plate recognition, specifically for the detection stage.
## OCR
Pytesseract is a Python wrapper for Google's Tesseract OCR (Optical Character Recognition) engine. It provides a convenient way to extract text from images or scanned documents using Tesseract.
